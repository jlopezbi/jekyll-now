Josh LB: I forked Jekyll Now. Now I am changing it.

#Tiled Works 
- uses flexboxes to achieve layout
- uses liquid expression to detect wether number of works i s odd or even. Adds empty work to keep columns nice for the last row, in odd case. This works because the default width results in two columns. This will break for numCols>2. Probably need to do some sort of more complex modulo computation to fix.
