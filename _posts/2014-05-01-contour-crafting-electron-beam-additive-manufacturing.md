<p>Contour crafting is a layered additive manufacture technique, much like that of ABS or PLA 3d printers such as the <a href="http://www.makerbot.com/?gclid=CJSv7tOyib4CFWuhOgodlw4APA">makerbot</a>, but with the addition of trowels which shape the extrusion to create a nice surface finish. Check out <a href="http://www.contourcrafting.org/">http://www.contourcrafting.org/</a>. Also check out the projects that <a href="http://www.bkhoshnevis.com/?page_id=22">Behrokh Khoshnevis</a> is working on. Pretty neat.</p>

<p>In one of his papers (<a href="http://contourcrafting.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/AIC2004-Paper1.pdf">contour crafting paper</a>) he talks about the possible applications of contour crafting, especially the fabrication of building walls and roofs. It presents some pretty fascinating ideas about modular rebar, electrical and plumbing systems that are integrated into the wall-extruder.</p>
<p>I wonder if techniques like the <a href="http://www.mmsonline.com/videos/video-electron-beam-direct-manufacturing">electron beam additive manufacturing </a>and  Joris Laarman Lab's <a href="http://www.jorislaarman.com/mx3d-metal.html">MX3D</a> project might be applicable to a rebar reinforcement system for extruded walls and roofs.</p>

<p>One problem with these systems is the need for a giant gantry system to make something big. The aforementioned paper suggests mobile robots which move about to access various parts of the structure, much like a set of human workers moving about while working on a large building. I wonder if it would be possible to create mobile robots which are designed to move directly on the structure they have previously created. This is similar to the '<a href="http://news.sciencemag.org/technology/2014/02/termite-inspired-robots-build-bricks">termite robots</a>' project, but with extrusion instead of discrete-unit deposition. (here is the <a href="http://www.sciencemag.org/content/343/6172/754.full?ijkey=wcGE/tKMM5iGM&amp;keytype=ref&amp;siteid=sci" target="_blank">termite robots paper</a>, here is the <a href="http://www.eecs.harvard.edu/ssr/research/index.html">self-organizing system research group</a>). One problem with such a system would be feeding material to a robot that keeps moving around. One advantage would be the ability to make structures that are many times larger than the robot itself.</p>

<p>Another thing all this stuff makes me wonder about is dedicated extruders for specific cross sections. Like an extruder head which prints a circular cross section, so that it can make tubes. Mounted on a 3D robotic positioning system, like a multi-axis robotic arm, one could make tubes that follow complex space curves. That would be neat.</p>
