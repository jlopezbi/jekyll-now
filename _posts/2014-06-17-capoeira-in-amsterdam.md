<p>Capoeira is a Brazilian martial art / dance / music tradition that I enjoy doing. I found a great academy here in Amsterdam and over the weekend I participated in a Caxixi-making workshop. A caxixi is a rattle that is one part of an instrument called the berimbau, which is the most important part of Capoeira music. Here is the Caxixi I made:<a href="http://joshlopezbinder.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/0616141852.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-339" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/0616141852-576x1024.jpg" alt="0616141852" width="576" height="1024" /></a></p>
<p>a neat method of weaving, and pretty clever means of closing the top off so it looks seamless and stays closed. Makes me think about robotic manufacture of radially symmetric objects haha...</p>
