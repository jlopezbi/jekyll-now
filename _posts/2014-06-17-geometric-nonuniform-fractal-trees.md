<p>There is something so nice about fractalÂ trees. Here are some that I generated in rhinoPython using L-systems as described in the Algorithmic Beauty of Plants. L-systems are a really neat way of defining and creating various fractal and fractal-like geometry so that one does not need to write new code to make different fractals. Im thinking about making some little connector pieces so I can make models of these with dowels. I like them because they are highly regular and geometric in definition, yet somehow my eye sees them as rather organic from some angles, especially when the trees have certain branch angles (20 degrees seems quite nice).</p>
<p>I say nonUniform fractal because of Mandelbort, ch.16, Trees; Scaling Residues; Nonuniform fractals in The Fractal Geometry of Nature.</p>
