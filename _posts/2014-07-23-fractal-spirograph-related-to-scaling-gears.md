<p>I posted this sketch a while ago of an idea for a kinetic sculpture made of nested planetary gears.  Which was a derivative of the <a title="Kinetic Sculptures" href="http://joshlopezbinder.com/works/kinetic-sculptures/">log spiral gear thingy</a>. These ideas are basically the same as, or extremely related to, this!:</p>

<p>and even better this:</p>

<p>These are interesting visually, and certainly could lead to some nice kinetic sculptures. But I also find them stimulating because they suggest fractal-motions, and maybe are even related to kinematics in organisms. The radius of curvature of the paths makes these wonderful crescendos and cascades. The motion actually reminds me of the counter balance (or counter torque) motions in slack-lining. (like tight rope-walking but on a not-so stiff strap) While trying out slack lining with a wonderfully happenstance acquaintance, I was informed that the best way to use the arms to counter-balance is to 'loosen-up' and move the arms in a smooth, graceful sort of way. Instead of holding the arms rigid and pivoting only at the shoulder, all the joints (shoulder, elbow, wrist, fingers!) get involved. These sort of motions may be similar to the tentical-like spiral kinetic sculpture I made and its analogous animation (above right). It did seem to help me balance better. While this is wild speculation, as I have been to lazy to try any real attempt at analysis, I wonder if these motions are somehow better for counter torquing while balancing? I wonder how the tails of various balancing creatures (cats, squirrels) behave.</p>
