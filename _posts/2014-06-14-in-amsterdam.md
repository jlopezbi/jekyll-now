<p>Wow, I have been in Amsterdam for a week.</p>
<p>Here is the bike I bought, on the first day too, since it was immediately apparent that a bike is essential to living here.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-332" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/1401976947238.jpg" alt="1401976947238" width="520" height="293" /></p>
<p>I am working at <a href="http://www.jorislaarman.com/#/winter_alpha/2bonechair_justpolished">joris laarman studio</a>, a fantastic design studio that uses developing technologies and methodologies, like 3D printing, CNC milling and computational form generation. I am working on the <a href="http://www.jorislaarman.com/mx3d-metal.html">MX3D</a> project. The project is to develop and explore the 3D printing in steel using a MIG welder and a 6 axis robotic arm. So far I have been working on dealing with programming the robot to follow complex paths. While the robot gives a great advantage in that it can position the welder, which deposits steel, in nearly any orientation and position, it also can be extremely difficult to program so that it can follow complex paths without running into errors. In the same way that the human arm has limits on the angles that the various joints can sweep out, the robot can get stuck if a joint rotates too far in one direction. It turns out much of the stuff we do when we move objects around with our arms and hands is really complex and quite clever. Trying to imitate this is a challenge.</p>
<p>Anyway besides thinking about <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zlGCurgsqg8">singularities</a> and robot configurations, exploring Amsterdam has been quite interesting. I checked out the Van Gogh Museum, which was very nice and rather inspiring, hung out in Vondelpark (the biggest, most popular, and absolutely stunning park in amsterdam) and did some touristy sightseeing in the central part of Amsterdam. Amsterdam is riddled with canals, which create a fantastically layed-back ambience, in combination with the multitude of single-speed bikes. (Some might argue that the legality of marijuana might have something to do with said ambience, but from what I gather very few dutch smoke weed! Its mostly tourists, apparently). There are even house boats and little houses that are built in canals!</p>

<p>more soon...</p>
